                    World-renowned vocalist <b>Elena Ostrovsky</b> began her operatic career in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
                    where she graduated from the Rimsky Korsakov Conservatory.  She also performed and worked with 
                    Liya Mogilevskaya; the principal vocal coach and pianist for Bolshoi Theater - Russia’s leading 
                    opera house.   After moving to the United States, Elena studied under great maestros Francisco 
                    Iglesias and Richard Barrett and performed at some of the most prestigious American opera venues.
                     She made her major American debut in Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff) at Carnegie Hall. Later, 
                     she performed at Lincoln Center’s Merkin Hall and Avery Fisher Hall.</br> 
                    Ms. Ostrovsky sang on recital tours in Canada, France, Austria, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Taiwan. 
                    She participated in the Monterrey, Mexico opera gala Voice and Light.  Her live performance at world 
                    famous St. Petersburg festival White Nights was released as her first album.  In 2004, Elena recorded
                     and album with Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Maestro Peter Schmelzer with Artistic 
                     Director Maestro Franco Iglesias.</br>

                    In 2010, her radiant opera career came to a halt when she suffered a tragic accident which left her 
                    comatosed and experiencing multiple bouts of organ failure.  Doctors were not confident about her 
                    viability, even if she were to survive.  But with tremendous advocacy by her husband Igor, a doctor 
                    himself, Ms. Ostrovsky was able to make a remarkable and truly miraculous recovery - against all odds.</br>  

                    The ordeal, which involved extended intubation for artificial respiration, left her with significant 
                    damage to her vocal cords.  Ms. Ostrovsky feared her singing career had come to a permanent close. 
                      However, her passion, perseverance, and dedication demanded that she continue to try.  
                      After rigorous vocal and physical  therapy, Ms. Ostrovsky regained her voice - albeit a 
                      new one - which she explored with enthusiasm and joy.</br> 

                    Currently, Ms. Ostrovsky has made a foray into the world of more contemporary music; mainly 
                    American Songbook and Jazz Standards and newly imagined art songs based on Silver Age Russian 
                    poetry and the works of Zlata Razdolina. She made her non-operatic debut in Manhattan in May of 2019 
                    at Scandinavia House to a full audience and rave reviews.</br> 
                    Ms. Ostrovsky is currently recording her album The Return, drawing from the richness of her life 
                    experiences.  The album is being produced and arranged by internationally acclaimed producer, 
                    arranger, and pianist <a href="url" class="jsilva">Jetro Silva </a> (Cush Records 357), who has worked with a platinum cast of 
                    top-tier recording artists including Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, and many others. 
                    The Return is expected to be released in October 2019. In addition to her own career, Ms. Ostrovsky 
                    dedicates herself to the education and support of aspiring young opera singers. In that capacity, 
                    she has participated in international auditions, festivals, and workshops in Russia,  Italy, 
                    Georgia, Latvia, South Korea, and the United States.
